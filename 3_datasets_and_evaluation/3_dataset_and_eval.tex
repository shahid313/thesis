\chapter{Datasets and Evaluation}\label{ch:datasets}
Every problem to be solved with machine learning and data mining techniques
requires the availability of data for algorithm parametrization: the ability to
access public dataset, representative of a real scenario, allows to test the approaches, in order to evaluate the effective benefit in real applications, and
to compare the performance of existing approaches on a common comparison
basis. A reliable
evaluation procedure for a classification or recognition system will involve a
standard dataset of example input data along with the intended target output, and
well-defined metrics to compare the systemsâ€™ outputs with this ground truth. 

%TODO Define typical characteristics of dataset acquisition
