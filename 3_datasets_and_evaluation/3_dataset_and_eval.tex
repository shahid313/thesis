\chapter{Datasets and Evaluation}\label{ch:datasets}
Every problem to be solved with machine learning and in particular with deep learning techniques requires the availability of a sufficient amount data for algorithm parametrization: the ability to access public dataset, representative of a real scenario, allows to test the approaches, in order to evaluate the effective benefit in real applications, and
to compare the performance of existing algorithms on a common comparison basis. A reliable evaluation procedure for a classification or recognition system will involve a
standard dataset of example input data along with the intended target output, and well-defined metrics to compare the systems' outputs with this ground truth.
